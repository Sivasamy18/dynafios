                The <strong>Dynafios APP</strong> log in page is the starting point to a robust
                application for the evaluation, approval and processing of
                payments for provider time and effort tied to contractual 
                arrangements.
                </p>

                <p>
                This comprehensive system creates an easy way for both
                independent and employed providers to capture activities,
                as well as health system users to approve and make
                payments associated with contracts that require payment
                for services.
